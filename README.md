## What is a Caesar Cipher?

Coined after Julius Caesar himself, the caesar cipher is one of the most basic and widely recognized encryption techniques.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## How to use

- Users can simple enter 2 arguments: a string and an integer

- The string represents the text that the caesar cipher will be applied to

- The integer represents the number of positions in the alphabet that each letter in the text will be shifted

- Once program is executed it will return your very own secret code
